# Time Logging app

## Description
This app is like a stopwatch that allows the user measure the time passed. Also, it allows the user to create multiple meters cards, as well as add title and description and delete cards.

## Framework
 - [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
 - [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)

## Key Concepts

### Definitions
- A component should, ideally, only be responsible for one piece of functionnality;
- A component to be used in other components and not manages states is called **widget**

### Instructions to create a React app from scratch:
1. Break the app into components.
2. Build a static version of the app.
3. Determine what should be stateful.
4. Determine in which component each piece of state should live.
5. Hard-code initial state.
6. Add inverse data flow.
7. Add server communication.
